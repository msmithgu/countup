A simple stopwatch with logging and a running average.

Hosted at http://countup.metacode.us

I wrote this when I couldn't find a simple stopwatch app or website (that worked cleanly on my phone) to track my average times for Rubik's Cube solving (I'm down to 2 minutes and 30 seconds average so far).

Feel free to use it for your needs as you will.
